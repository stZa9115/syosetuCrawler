The EbookLib library doesn't have a built-in function or method to directly convert an ordered list (OL) into an unordered list (UL) within the table of contents (TOC). However, you can achieve this by modifying the HTML content of the TOC yourself.

Here's a general approach:

1. **Load the EPUB file:** Use the `epub.read_epub()` function to load the EPUB file into an Epub object.
2. **Get the TOC:** Access the TOC using the `epub.toc` attribute.
3. **Iterate through TOC entries:** Loop through each TOC entry.
4. **Modify HTML content:** For each entry, replace the `<ol>` tag with `<ul>` and remove any `type` attribute from the `<li>` tags.
5. **Save the modified EPUB:** Use the `epub.save()` function to save the modified EPUB file.

Here's a code example:

```python
import ebooklib
from ebooklib import epub

def convert_ol_to_ul(epub_file):
    epub = epub.read_epub(epub_file)

    for item in epub.toc:
        content = item.content
        content = content.replace("<ol>", "<ul>", 1)  # Replace the first occurrence
        content = content.replace("<li type=", "<li", 1)  # Remove the first type attribute
        item.content = content

    epub.save(epub_file)

# Example usage
epub_file = "your_epub_file.epub"
convert_ol_to_ul(epub_file)
```

This code will iterate through the TOC entries, replace the `<ol>` tag with `<ul>`, and remove the `type` attribute from the `<li>` tags. You can adjust this code to fit your specific needs and handle more complex scenarios if necessary.

Keep in mind that modifying the EPUB file directly might affect other aspects of the book, so it's important to test the modified EPUB carefully before distributing it.
